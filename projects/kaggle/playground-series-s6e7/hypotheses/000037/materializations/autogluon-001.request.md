Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz

Original source-style student health dataset downloaded from Kaggle dataset
`ziya07/college-student-health-behavior-dataset`. The file is stored as
`data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz`.

Kaggle dataset page description: this is a 50,000-record student health dataset
intended to capture lifestyle, physiological, and psychological characteristics
of college students. The page describes records as time-stamped observations
combining survey-style attributes, wearable-device-style measurements, and
institutional health-record-style signals. The dataset is described as modeled
on trends from large-scale student health studies in China and intended to
represent variation in sleep, stress, physical activity, academic pressure,
mental well-being, and health risk.

It has 50,000 rows and includes the target column `health_condition` with
classes `at-risk`, `unhealthy`, and `fit`. Class counts are 43,718 at-risk,
3,816 unhealthy, and 2,466 fit.

Columns:
- `student_id`
- `timestamp`
- `sleep_duration`
- `heart_rate`
- `bmi`
- `calorie_expenditure`
- `step_count`
- `exercise_duration`
- `water_intake`
- `diet_type`
- `stress_level`
- `sleep_quality`
- `physical_activity_level`
- `smoking_alcohol`
- `gender`
- `health_condition`

Note: the Kaggle dataset page also describes broader feature categories such as
screen time, sitting time, academic pressure, mental health status, and social
relationships. Those fields are present in the separate
`enhanced_student_health_dataset_50k.xls` file listed by Kaggle, but they are
not present in the `student_health_dataset_50k.csv` file configured here for TML.

Overlap with Kaggle train/test: all feature columns except `student_id` and
`timestamp` match Kaggle feature names. The external `student_id` is separate
from Kaggle `id`; do not assume the identifiers can be joined. The `timestamp`
column is external-only and may support source-domain temporal summaries, but it
is not present in Kaggle train/test rows.

Use this dataset only as auxiliary/external data. Do not assume `student_id`
matches Kaggle `id`; treat it as a separate identifier. Avoid target leakage:
`health_condition` can be used for auxiliary supervised statistics only when the
implementation fits those statistics on training folds or otherwise avoids using
validation/test labels.

# Hypothesis
- title: Inferred Non-Exercise Energy Residual
- group_name: nonexercise_energy_residual
- family: energy_partition_residual
- summary: Represent each student by the unstructured daily energy expenditure implied after accounting for body context and explicit movement signals, separating steady incidental movers from low-throughput or exercise-concentrated profiles.
- strategy: Use only raw columns and train-only, target-free distribution statistics. For calculation-only inputs, leave original columns unchanged but replace missing sleep_duration, bmi, step_count, exercise_duration, and calorie_expenditure with train medians; set missing gender to unknown. Estimate waking_hours = clip(24 - sleep_duration, 14, 21). Create coarse body, step, and exercise bands using BMI cutpoints 18.5, 25, and 30; step_count cutpoints 5000, 8000, and 12000; and exercise_duration bands 0, 0-30, 30-60, and 60+. Among train rows with observed calorie_expenditure, compute the median expected calorie_expenditure for cells of body_band x step_band x exercise_band x gender, backing off to body_band x step_band x exercise_band, then step_band x exercise_band, then the global median whenever a cell has fewer than 500 rows. For each train/test row derive residual = observed calorie_expenditure - expected_calorie_expenditure, residual_z = residual divided by the train IQR of residuals, residual_per_waking_hour = residual / waking_hours, residual_to_exercise = residual / (exercise_duration + 10), and a five-level residual bin at <= -1 IQR, -1 to -0.25 IQR, -0.25 to 0.25 IQR, 0.25 to 1 IQR, and > 1 IQR; if calorie_expenditure is missing, set continuous residual features to 0 and the bin to unknown_energy.
- expected_signal: Non-exercise activity thermogenesis is described as a major variable part of daily energy use beyond formal exercise, and total energy expenditure is commonly decomposed into resting, diet, and physical-activity components including NEAT; this residual may distinguish fit-like students with high incidental movement or metabolic throughput from unhealthy-like low-throughput profiles even when their steps and exercise minutes look similar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/, https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/26818/chapter/6).
- risk: The residual can be redundant with calorie_expenditure, step_count, and exercise_duration if the source generator already ties these tightly together; sparse backoff cells and missing calorie_expenditure can make the signal noisy, though using target-free train statistics avoids label leakage.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
