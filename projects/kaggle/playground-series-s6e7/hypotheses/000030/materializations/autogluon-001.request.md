Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz

Original source-style student health dataset downloaded from Kaggle dataset
`ziya07/college-student-health-behavior-dataset`. The file is stored as
`data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz`.

Kaggle dataset page description: this is a 50,000-record student health dataset
intended to capture lifestyle, physiological, and psychological characteristics
of college students. The page describes records as time-stamped observations
combining survey-style attributes, wearable-device-style measurements, and
institutional health-record-style signals. The dataset is described as modeled
on trends from large-scale student health studies in China and intended to
represent variation in sleep, stress, physical activity, academic pressure,
mental well-being, and health risk.

It has 50,000 rows and includes the target column `health_condition` with
classes `at-risk`, `unhealthy`, and `fit`. Class counts are 43,718 at-risk,
3,816 unhealthy, and 2,466 fit.

Columns:
- `student_id`
- `timestamp`
- `sleep_duration`
- `heart_rate`
- `bmi`
- `calorie_expenditure`
- `step_count`
- `exercise_duration`
- `water_intake`
- `diet_type`
- `stress_level`
- `sleep_quality`
- `physical_activity_level`
- `smoking_alcohol`
- `gender`
- `health_condition`

Note: the Kaggle dataset page also describes broader feature categories such as
screen time, sitting time, academic pressure, mental health status, and social
relationships. Those fields are present in the separate
`enhanced_student_health_dataset_50k.xls` file listed by Kaggle, but they are
not present in the `student_health_dataset_50k.csv` file configured here for TML.

Overlap with Kaggle train/test: all feature columns except `student_id` and
`timestamp` match Kaggle feature names. The external `student_id` is separate
from Kaggle `id`; do not assume the identifiers can be joined. The `timestamp`
column is external-only and may support source-domain temporal summaries, but it
is not present in Kaggle train/test rows.

Use this dataset only as auxiliary/external data. Do not assume `student_id`
matches Kaggle `id`; treat it as a separate identifier. Avoid target leakage:
`health_condition` can be used for auxiliary supervised statistics only when the
implementation fits those statistics on training folds or otherwise avoids using
validation/test labels.

# Hypothesis
- title: Auxiliary Recovery-Worsening Trajectory Affinity
- group_name: external_transition_phase_affinity
- family: external_temporal_supervised
- summary: Represent each static student profile by its resemblance to auxiliary-source lifestyle states that appear before or after health-status worsening, recovery, or stability, capturing latent trajectory phase rather than only present-state wellness.
- strategy: Use only data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz as the auxiliary source and never join on student_id or id. Sort auxiliary rows by student_id and timestamp, map fit=0, at-risk=1, unhealthy=2, then assign each row a transition phase from adjacent same-student severity changes: stable_current_class when previous and next observed severities match the current severity, pre_worsen_current_class when the next severity is higher, pre_recover_current_class when the next severity is lower, post_worsen_current_class when the previous severity was lower, and post_recover_current_class when the previous severity was higher. Collapse phase buckets with fewer than 200 rows into direction-only buckets while keeping stable class buckets. Build robust phase centroids over the common train/test feature columns: winsorize numeric auxiliary values at the auxiliary 1st and 99th percentiles, scale by auxiliary median and IQR, encode categoricals with one-hot levels plus an explicit missing token for project rows, and add numeric missing flags for project rows because the auxiliary file has no missing values. For each project row, apply the same transform and emit inverse-distance soft affinities to each retained phase centroid, the best worsening affinity, best recovery affinity, best stable-class affinity, worsening-minus-recovery margin, recovery-minus-stable margin, and severity-weighted mean of phase affinities; rows with all common fields missing receive neutral centroid distances plus missing-flag evidence.
- expected_signal: Student-health literature links sleep quality, stress, exercise, activity, BMI, and physiological recovery as coupled risk-and-recovery factors, so transition-phase affinity may separate boundary cases such as fit students drifting toward at-risk from at-risk students resembling recovery or deterioration patterns; background sources used include https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1640974/full, https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2022/22_0060.htm, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK566046/, and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-016-3391-4.
- risk: The auxiliary timestamps and repeated student records may be synthetic or weakly ordered, so inferred worsening and recovery phases can be noisy; rare transition buckets may be unstable after pooling, and the signal may partially overlap earlier external class-affinity groups even though it emphasizes directional phase rather than static class prototypes.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
