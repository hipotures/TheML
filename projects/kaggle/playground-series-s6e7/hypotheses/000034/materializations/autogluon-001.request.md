Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz

Original source-style student health dataset downloaded from Kaggle dataset
`ziya07/college-student-health-behavior-dataset`. The file is stored as
`data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz`.

Kaggle dataset page description: this is a 50,000-record student health dataset
intended to capture lifestyle, physiological, and psychological characteristics
of college students. The page describes records as time-stamped observations
combining survey-style attributes, wearable-device-style measurements, and
institutional health-record-style signals. The dataset is described as modeled
on trends from large-scale student health studies in China and intended to
represent variation in sleep, stress, physical activity, academic pressure,
mental well-being, and health risk.

It has 50,000 rows and includes the target column `health_condition` with
classes `at-risk`, `unhealthy`, and `fit`. Class counts are 43,718 at-risk,
3,816 unhealthy, and 2,466 fit.

Columns:
- `student_id`
- `timestamp`
- `sleep_duration`
- `heart_rate`
- `bmi`
- `calorie_expenditure`
- `step_count`
- `exercise_duration`
- `water_intake`
- `diet_type`
- `stress_level`
- `sleep_quality`
- `physical_activity_level`
- `smoking_alcohol`
- `gender`
- `health_condition`

Note: the Kaggle dataset page also describes broader feature categories such as
screen time, sitting time, academic pressure, mental health status, and social
relationships. Those fields are present in the separate
`enhanced_student_health_dataset_50k.xls` file listed by Kaggle, but they are
not present in the `student_health_dataset_50k.csv` file configured here for TML.

Overlap with Kaggle train/test: all feature columns except `student_id` and
`timestamp` match Kaggle feature names. The external `student_id` is separate
from Kaggle `id`; do not assume the identifiers can be joined. The `timestamp`
column is external-only and may support source-domain temporal summaries, but it
is not present in Kaggle train/test rows.

Use this dataset only as auxiliary/external data. Do not assume `student_id`
matches Kaggle `id`; treat it as a separate identifier. Avoid target leakage:
`health_condition` can be used for auxiliary supervised statistics only when the
implementation fits those statistics on training folds or otherwise avoids using
validation/test labels.

# Hypothesis
- title: Apparent Energy Availability Phase
- group_name: energy_availability_phase
- family: energy_balance_context
- summary: Represent whether a student's exertion demand appears adequately supported by body reserve and recovery context, separating well-supported high-throughput profiles from under-supported exertion and low-throughput surplus states.
- strategy: Using only training-derived unsupervised medians and percentile cut points, create a clipped activity-demand score as the mean percentile rank of calorie expenditure, steps, and exercise duration; create a recovery-support score from sleep amount closeness to a 7-9 hour band, water intake adequacy, favorable sleep-quality and stress ordinals, and balanced diet status; create body-context margins for low-BMI reserve deficit below 18.5, healthy-BMI band occupancy from 18.5 to 25, and high-BMI surplus above 25, each clipped to [0,1]. Derive coherent phase features: demand-minus-support gap, under-supported exertion pressure = high demand combined with low-BMI margin, weak recovery, and elevated heart-rate percentile; low-throughput surplus pressure = high-BMI margin combined with low demand and weak recovery; supported high-throughput score = high demand combined with healthy-BMI band, strong recovery, and non-elevated heart-rate percentile; and a deterministic phase label from the largest pressure score with a neutral label when all components are weak. Missing numeric values receive neutral median/0.5 percentile treatment for these calculations, missing categorical values receive neutral ordinal scores, all ratios and margins are clipped, and rows with all demand inputs missing are assigned neutral demand.
- expected_signal: This may improve balanced accuracy by making the fit, at-risk, and unhealthy classes more separable when similar activity levels have different risk meaning depending on recovery and body context; domain background supports activity-adiposity cardiometabolic clustering (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201497/) and energy-demand mismatch affecting cardiovascular and metabolic function (https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/relative-energy-deficiency-in-sport-red-s/).
- risk: The dataset lacks true calorie intake, height, age, and body composition, so the feature can confuse lean athletic students with energy-deficit risk or high-BMI active students with surplus risk; calorie-expenditure estimates may also be noisy and the group may partly overlap existing activity, recovery, and body-context representations.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
