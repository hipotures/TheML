Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz

Original source-style student health dataset downloaded from Kaggle dataset
`ziya07/college-student-health-behavior-dataset`. The file is stored as
`data/student_health_dataset_50k.csv.gz`.

Kaggle dataset page description: this is a 50,000-record student health dataset
intended to capture lifestyle, physiological, and psychological characteristics
of college students. The page describes records as time-stamped observations
combining survey-style attributes, wearable-device-style measurements, and
institutional health-record-style signals. The dataset is described as modeled
on trends from large-scale student health studies in China and intended to
represent variation in sleep, stress, physical activity, academic pressure,
mental well-being, and health risk.

It has 50,000 rows and includes the target column `health_condition` with
classes `at-risk`, `unhealthy`, and `fit`. Class counts are 43,718 at-risk,
3,816 unhealthy, and 2,466 fit.

Columns:
- `student_id`
- `timestamp`
- `sleep_duration`
- `heart_rate`
- `bmi`
- `calorie_expenditure`
- `step_count`
- `exercise_duration`
- `water_intake`
- `diet_type`
- `stress_level`
- `sleep_quality`
- `physical_activity_level`
- `smoking_alcohol`
- `gender`
- `health_condition`

Note: the Kaggle dataset page also describes broader feature categories such as
screen time, sitting time, academic pressure, mental health status, and social
relationships. Those fields are present in the separate
`enhanced_student_health_dataset_50k.xls` file listed by Kaggle, but they are
not present in the `student_health_dataset_50k.csv` file configured here for TML.

Overlap with Kaggle train/test: all feature columns except `student_id` and
`timestamp` match Kaggle feature names. The external `student_id` is separate
from Kaggle `id`; do not assume the identifiers can be joined. The `timestamp`
column is external-only and may support source-domain temporal summaries, but it
is not present in Kaggle train/test rows.

Use this dataset only as auxiliary/external data. Do not assume `student_id`
matches Kaggle `id`; treat it as a separate identifier. Avoid target leakage:
`health_condition` can be used for auxiliary supervised statistics only when the
implementation fits those statistics on training folds or otherwise avoids using
validation/test labels.

# Hypothesis
- title: Source Value Popularity Signature
- group_name: source_value_popularity_signature
- family: unsupervised_frequency_encoding
- summary: Represent whether each student profile is assembled from common or rare source-distribution values and coarse states, treating value popularity as a compact source-generation context signal rather than a direct health-behavior score.
- strategy: Fit all statistics on training features only, excluding id and health_condition. For each raw feature, create an explicit missing token; for categorical columns use exact category tokens, and for numeric columns use both exact recorded values and fixed coarse bins: sleep_duration in 0.5-hour bins, heart_rate in 5-bpm bins, bmi in 1-unit bins, calorie_expenditure in 100-kcal bins, step_count in 1000-step bins, exercise_duration in 10-minute bins, and water_intake in 0.25-liter bins. Compute per-column token counts and frequencies with additive smoothing alpha=1 over N plus the number of observed tokens. For each row, map exact and coarse tokens to log frequency and within-column frequency percentile, then output row-level summaries separately for exact and coarse representations: mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, sum of negative log frequency, count of rare tokens where frequency is below 0.001 or count is below 50, and count of unseen tokens encoded with the smoothed floor.
- expected_signal: Count and frequency encodings are documented tabular representations that can expose popularity or rarity structure without labels, and tabular competition feature engineering references highlight count features and binning as useful source-pattern signals (https://feature-engine.trainindata.com/en/1.8.x/user_guide/encoding/CountFrequencyEncoder.html; https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/grandmaster-pro-tip-winning-first-place-in-kaggle-competition-with-feature-engineering-using-nvidia-cudf-pandas/), so minority health classes may become easier to separate if they occupy less common exact or coarse value strata.
- risk: May capture source-generation artifacts rather than stable health mechanisms, can be redundant with existing measurement-quality or profile-rarity groups, and rare or unseen frequencies are sensitive to train-test distribution shift despite smoothing.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
