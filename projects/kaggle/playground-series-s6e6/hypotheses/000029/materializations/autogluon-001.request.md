Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for /home/xai/DEV/aideml/workspaces/2-liberal-celadon-panther/input/star_classification.csv

Original SDSS17 Stellar Classification Dataset.

This is the original real-world dataset that inspired the synthetic Playground
Series S6E6 competition data. It can be used as raw auxiliary data, but it is
not automatically merged with train.csv or test.csv.

Common columns with the competition data:
alpha, delta, u, g, r, i, z, redshift, class.

Columns present in this original dataset but not in the competition files:
obj_ID, run_ID, rerun_ID, cam_col, field_ID, spec_obj_ID, plate, MJD, fiber_ID.

Competition columns not present in this original dataset:
id, spectral_type, galaxy_population.

Generated code should decide whether and how to use this file. Any merge,
filtering, cleaning of sentinel magnitudes, or column mapping must be done
explicitly by the generated solution code.

# Hypothesis
- title: Lyman-break dropout geometry across redshifted bands
- group_name: redshifted_lyman_discontinuity
- family: restframe_discontinuity
- summary: Create features that quantify where and how strongly the broadband SED drops across the rest-frame Lyman-limit and Lyman-alpha edges as they sweep through ugriz bands, giving direct physically interpretable dropout geometry for class separation.
- strategy: Use the fixed SDSS effective wavelengths [u,g,r,i,z] = [3551, 4686, 6165, 7481, 8931] Å and each object's redshift z to evaluate two breaks B in {912 Å, 1216 Å}. Convert ugriz magnitudes to linear flux proxies f_b = 10^{-0.4 m_b}. For each break B, compute λ_rest = λ/(1+z) for all five bands and let idx = first index where λ_rest[idx] >= B. If idx == 0 or idx == 5, mark edge_available_B = 0 and emit neutral defaults (jump_B = 0, local_B = 0, phase_B = 0); else set edge_available_B = 1, define phase_B = clip((B - λ_rest[idx-1]) / (λ_rest[idx] - λ_rest[idx-1]), 0, 1), jump_B = log10((mean(f[idx:]) + eps)/(mean(f[:idx]) + eps)), and local_B = m[idx-1] - m[idx], with eps = 1e-12. Add a compact positional encoding break_band_B = idx (0..5 or one-hot bins: below u, u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z, above z) and optionally interaction terms jump_B * break_band_B and local_B * edge_available_B to stabilize extreme edges.
- expected_signal: These features should capture physically motivated absorption/continuum-break behavior that is not fully represented by global color slopes, especially for high-redshift quasars and galaxies where the blue-to-red flux jump around Lyα/Lyman-limit is a strong discriminator, while neutralizing to near-zero for low-redshift objects where breaks are outside ugriz coverage.
- risk: Dependence on provided redshift introduces sensitivity to redshift errors and can create unstable boundary assignments when z is noisy; u-band sensitivity and calibration variation can also generate spurious jump magnitudes, and some information may overlap with other break/line-geometry families so gains may be incremental if those are already strong.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
