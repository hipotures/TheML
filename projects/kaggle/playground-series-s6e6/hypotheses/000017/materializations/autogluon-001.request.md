Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# Hypothesis
- title: Cosmological luminosity plausibility
- group_name: redshift_luminosity_plausibility
- family: absolute_photometry
- summary: Transform apparent ugriz brightness through the object's reported redshift into redshift-scaled intrinsic luminosity plausibility signals, so the classifier can distinguish nearby stellar objects from intrinsically luminous galaxies and quasars.
- strategy: For each row, compute a deterministic luminosity-distance proxy from redshift using a fixed flat cosmology approximation with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_m=0.3, and Omega_lambda=0.7; clip redshift only for distance calculation to z_eff=max(redshift, 1e-4), and retain signed indicators for redshift<=0 and redshift<0.01. Convert each apparent magnitude band m in u,g,r,i,z to a pseudo absolute magnitude M=m-5*log10(D_L_Mpc)-25 without k-correction. Derive coherent summaries over these pseudo absolute magnitudes: central intrinsic brightness level using r and i bands, brightest and faintest pseudo absolute band, band-to-band absolute-magnitude spread, mean pseudo absolute magnitude, and margins to fixed astrophysical luminosity regimes such as stellar-like faint intrinsic scale, normal-galaxy scale, and quasar-like extreme luminosity scale using thresholds around M_r=-10, -18, -23, and -27. For numerical stability, cap luminosity distance and absolute-magnitude outputs at broad finite limits after calculation, and use the same fixed constants for train and test.
- expected_signal: Balanced accuracy may improve because the same observed colors and apparent magnitudes imply very different object classes depending on distance scale: stars should be compatible with near-zero redshift and modest intrinsic luminosity, galaxies occupy intermediate absolute magnitudes, and QSOs are often only plausible when the redshift-scaled luminosity is extreme.
- risk: The reported redshift may already dominate class separation, and pseudo absolute magnitudes without k-correction can be physically crude at high redshift, so the group may be partly redundant with existing redshift and photometric features or unstable for near-zero and slightly negative redshifts.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
