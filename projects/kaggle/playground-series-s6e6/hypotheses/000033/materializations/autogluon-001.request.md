Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for /home/xai/DEV/aideml/workspaces/2-liberal-celadon-panther/input/star_classification.csv

Original SDSS17 Stellar Classification Dataset.

This is the original real-world dataset that inspired the synthetic Playground
Series S6E6 competition data. It can be used as raw auxiliary data, but it is
not automatically merged with train.csv or test.csv.

Common columns with the competition data:
alpha, delta, u, g, r, i, z, redshift, class.

Columns present in this original dataset but not in the competition files:
obj_ID, run_ID, rerun_ID, cam_col, field_ID, spec_obj_ID, plate, MJD, fiber_ID.

Competition columns not present in this original dataset:
id, spectral_type, galaxy_population.

Generated code should decide whether and how to use this file. Any merge,
filtering, cleaning of sentinel magnitudes, or column mapping must be done
explicitly by the generated solution code.

# Hypothesis
- title: Rest-frame SED family fit residuals
- group_name: restframe_sed_family_fit
- family: spectral_family
- summary: Compare each object's rest-frame ugriz continuum against competing power-law and curved continuum family signatures to encode whether its broadband shape is quasar-like, star-like, or galaxy-like, using physically motivated rest-frame shape diagnostics that are orthogonal to absolute brightness.
- strategy: For each object, convert magnitudes to flux proxies f_b=10^{-0.4 m_b} for b in {u,g,r,i,z}, then compute x_b=log10(\lambda_b/(1+z_plus)) and y_b=log10(f_b), where \lambda=[3551,4686,6165,7481,8931] Å and z_plus=max(redshift,0). Fit two deterministic models to (x_b,y_b): linear model y=a+b\,x (power-law surrogate), and quadratic model y=c+d\,x+e\,x^2 (curved/thermal surrogate). Derive SSE_linear and SSE_quad from least-squares residuals, R2_linear and R2_quad, curvature gain g=(SSE_linear-SSE_quad)/SSE_linear, and signed curvature coefficient e. Add an endpoint slope-contrast feature s=(y_u-y_g)/(x_u-x_g)-(y_i-y_z)/(x_i-x_z). To reduce Lyman-forest/absorbed-band distortion at high redshift, compute a second weighted variant with weights w_b=1 if x_b_rest>1216 Å, 0.5 if 912 Å<\lambda_rest<=1216 Å, 0.2 if \lambda_rest<=912 Å, where \lambda_rest=\lambda_b/(1+z_plus); compute the same model statistics on weighted data and keep a binary fallback flag for the weighted fit when all weights are 1 (low-z regime), otherwise both sets are returned.
- expected_signal: Quasars are expected to be better explained by linear continua in log-log space (small curvature gain) while stars and many galaxies show stronger smooth curvature or break-driven slope asymmetry, so family-residual features should sharpen class boundaries near stellar and quasar overlaps and improve balanced discrimination.
- risk: Rest-frame warping amplifies redshift noise and any photometric-system calibration mismatch, especially for negative or noisy redshifts and very high-redshift objects with heavily absorbed blue bands; this can inject unstable curvature estimates and creates overlap with existing break/continuum groups, so feature utility may weaken if redshift quality is poor.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
