Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# Hypothesis
- title: Redshift-Calibrated Pseudo-Absolute Magnitude Profile
- group_name: distance_corrected_luminosity_signature
- family: luminosity_distance
- summary: Re-express the five observed magnitudes as a redshift-adjusted intrinsic brightness profile and summarize its central level, brightest/faintest inferred bands, and dispersion to expose class-specific luminosity regimes beyond apparent brightness.
- strategy: Use the raw redshift only to build a deterministic luminosity-distance surrogate. Set z_eff = clip(redshift, 1e-4, 7.5), treating unexpected missing redshift as 0 before clipping. With H0 = 70.0, c = 299792.458, and q0 = -0.55, compute d_L_mpc = (c / H0) * z_eff * (1 + 0.5 * (1 - q0) * z_eff), then clip d_L_mpc to [1e-4, 1e8]. For each photometric band b in {u, g, r, i, z}, compute pseudo-absolute magnitude M_b = mag_b - 5 * log10(d_L_mpc) - 25. From {M_u, M_g, M_r, M_i, M_z}, derive median, mean, min, max, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, IQR = p75 - p25, and span = max - min. Also add brightest-band and faintest-band categorical indicators from argmin(M_b) and argmax(M_b), and bin the median pseudo-absolute magnitude into regimes <= -27, (-27, -23], (-23, -19], (-19, -14], and > -14. All transforms are row-wise and fit-free; if a magnitude is unexpectedly missing, compute summaries from available bands and add the available-band count so missingness is explicit.
- expected_signal: Balanced accuracy may improve because galaxies, QSOs, and stars often occupy different implied luminosity scales even when their observed magnitudes or colors overlap; robust summaries and regime bins give the classifier nonlinear, class-balanced separation without relying on any target-derived calibration.
- risk: The distance formula is an approximate surrogate rather than a full cosmological calculation, so high-redshift objects and near-zero-redshift stars can receive distorted pseudo-absolute magnitudes; the features are also partly redundant with raw magnitudes and redshift and may amplify survey-specific redshift artifacts if the model overfits.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
