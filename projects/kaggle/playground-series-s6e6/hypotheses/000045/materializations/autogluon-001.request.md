Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for /home/xai/DEV/aideml/workspaces/2-liberal-celadon-panther/input/star_classification.csv

Original SDSS17 Stellar Classification Dataset.

This is the original real-world dataset that inspired the synthetic Playground
Series S6E6 competition data. It can be used as raw auxiliary data, but it is
not automatically merged with train.csv or test.csv.

Common columns with the competition data:
alpha, delta, u, g, r, i, z, redshift, class.

Columns present in this original dataset but not in the competition files:
obj_ID, run_ID, rerun_ID, cam_col, field_ID, spec_obj_ID, plate, MJD, fiber_ID.

Competition columns not present in this original dataset:
id, spectral_type, galaxy_population.

Generated code should decide whether and how to use this file. Any merge,
filtering, cleaning of sentinel magnitudes, or column mapping must be done
explicitly by the generated solution code.

# Hypothesis
- title: Full pairwise color lattice residuals
- group_name: pairwise_color_lattice_residuals
- family: pairwise_color_geometry
- summary: Model each object in the complete pairwise ugriz color lattice and its redshift-conditioned orthogonal residual geometry so non-adjacent color relationships and subtle color manifold departures that are missed by adjacent-color-only transforms become explicit class signals.
- strategy: For each row, compute the 10 pairwise color differences from the five magnitudes: u-g, u-r, u-i, u-z, g-r, g-i, g-z, r-i, r-z, i-z. Bin objects by redshift into fixed quantile bins (for example 32 bins), placing negative-redshift points into the lowest bin and merging neighboring bins if any bin has too few rows (fallback to global stats). For each bin, fit a robust center vector and scale vector (median and MAD) on all rows' 10-dimensional color vectors, then build a regularized covariance matrix (add 1e-6 to the diagonal if needed) and compute: (1) clipped standardized residuals per color (color minus median divided by MAD), (2) bin-conditional Mahalanobis distance of the 10-vector to the bin mean, and (3) the top 3 bin-conditional principal-residual scores from the whitened 10-vector (fixed deterministic eigenvector basis per bin). Output these as new numeric features only. If a bin is degenerate or ill-conditioned, use the nearest populated neighboring bin’s statistics. Use same transforms for train and test using statistics learned from the combined feature pool.
- expected_signal: The 10-color lattice captures cross-band contrast patterns beyond local slopes, and redshift-conditioned orthogonalized residuals should improve discrimination where stars, galaxies and quasars overlap in adjacent-color projections, especially in known degeneracy strips where one-dimensional color cuts are weak.
- risk: The representation is highly redundant and can overfit if too many correlated residual coordinates are added; covariance estimates in sparse high-redshift bins may become unstable, and fixed redshift-bin quantization can create boundary artifacts, especially if the true class boundaries move smoothly with redshift.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
