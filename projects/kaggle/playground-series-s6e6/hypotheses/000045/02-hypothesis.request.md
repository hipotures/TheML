# Project Context

## Goal
Predict the stellar class for each test-set object.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using balanced accuracy between predicted class labels and the true class. Submission file must contain `id,class` with one label per test row, where `class` is one of GALAXY, STAR, or QSO.

## Data description
`train.csv` contains 577347 rows with 10 feature columns plus `id`, `galaxy_population`, `spectral_type`, and the target `class`. `test.csv` contains the same predictors without the target across 247435 rows. `sample_submission.csv` shows the required submission columns `id` and `class`. The target is a 3-class stellar classification problem with labels GALAXY, QSO, and STAR.

# Instruction

Analyze the selected ROOT hypothesis, the project context, and the previous
revisions.

Create the next revision by expanding or improving the hypothesis while
preserving its substantive feature-group idea. You are not writing code. You are
not creating a new feature group.

The revision should make the hypothesis more precise, internally consistent,
implementable, or better justified. Improve the hypothesis text, especially
`strategy`, when there is a concrete useful improvement. Do not force arbitrary
changes.

Use previous revisions only as context. If they contain useful details, use that
context, but do not mechanically merge them. The output must be one coherent
revised hypothesis using exactly the same JSON schema as a newly generated
hypothesis.

# Web Search

Live web search is enabled. If internet verification is useful, use the
`web_search` tool before writing the revised hypothesis. Check at most 3 sources.
Use web search only to verify domain facts, feature-engineering background,
validation risks, or implementation constraints relevant to the selected
hypothesis. Do not use web search to invent a different feature-group idea, copy
a public solution, or broaden the scope. If web search is not useful, continue
without inventing sources.

# Selected Hypothesis

Hypothesis ID: 000045

Previous versions:

- rev 1: Full pairwise color lattice residuals
  group_name=pairwise_color_lattice_residuals
  family=pairwise_color_geometry
  summary=Model each object in the complete pairwise ugriz color lattice and its redshift-conditioned orthogonal residual geometry so non-adjacent color relationships and subtle color manifold departures that are missed by adjacent-color-only transforms become explicit class signals.
  strategy=For each row, compute the 10 pairwise color differences from the five magnitudes: u-g, u-r, u-i, u-z, g-r, g-i, g-z, r-i, r-z, i-z. Bin objects by redshift into fixed quantile bins (for example 32 bins), placing negative-redshift points into the lowest bin and merging neighboring bins if any bin has too few rows (fallback to global stats). For each bin, fit a robust center vector and scale vector (median and MAD) on all rows' 10-dimensional color vectors, then build a regularized covariance matrix (add 1e-6 to the diagonal if needed) and compute: (1) clipped standardized residuals per color (color minus median divided by MAD), (2) bin-conditional Mahalanobis distance of the 10-vector to the bin mean, and (3) the top 3 bin-conditional principal-residual scores from the whitened 10-vector (fixed deterministic eigenvector basis per bin). Output these as new numeric features only. If a bin is degenerate or ill-conditioned, use the nearest populated neighboring bin’s statistics. Use same transforms for train and test using statistics learned from the combined feature pool.
  expected_signal=The 10-color lattice captures cross-band contrast patterns beyond local slopes, and redshift-conditioned orthogonalized residuals should improve discrimination where stars, galaxies and quasars overlap in adjacent-color projections, especially in known degeneracy strips where one-dimensional color cuts are weak.
  risk=The representation is highly redundant and can overfit if too many correlated residual coordinates are added; covariance estimates in sparse high-redshift bins may become unstable, and fixed redshift-bin quantization can create boundary artifacts, especially if the true class boundaries move smoothly with redshift.
