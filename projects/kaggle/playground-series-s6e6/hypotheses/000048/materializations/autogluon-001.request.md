Write preprocessing feature-group code for an AutoGluon wrapper.

Your output must define one semantic feature group for preprocessing.
The fixed wrapper imports this file, runs `FEATURE_GROUPS`, logs group timing,
renames returned columns, assembles the final DataFrame, and handles all
non-preprocessing work.

Do not write the wrapper.

# External Data Description for /home/xai/DEV/aideml/workspaces/2-liberal-celadon-panther/input/star_classification.csv

Original SDSS17 Stellar Classification Dataset.

This is the original real-world dataset that inspired the synthetic Playground
Series S6E6 competition data. It can be used as raw auxiliary data, but it is
not automatically merged with train.csv or test.csv.

Common columns with the competition data:
alpha, delta, u, g, r, i, z, redshift, class.

Columns present in this original dataset but not in the competition files:
obj_ID, run_ID, rerun_ID, cam_col, field_ID, spec_obj_ID, plate, MJD, fiber_ID.

Competition columns not present in this original dataset:
id, spectral_type, galaxy_population.

Generated code should decide whether and how to use this file. Any merge,
filtering, cleaning of sentinel magnitudes, or column mapping must be done
explicitly by the generated solution code.

# Hypothesis
- title: Luptitude regime-aware flux re-parameterization
- group_name: luptitude_regime_flux_features
- family: asinh_flux_domain
- summary: Transform SDSS asinh magnitudes into a flux-domain representation that explicitly models the low-signal linear regime and AB calibration idiosyncrasies, then describe each object’s spectral shape and color behavior with regime-aware flux-based descriptors to stabilize class clues near the photometric detection floor.
- strategy: Apply the SDSS u-band AB correction u_ab = u - 0.04 first. Convert each band magnitude m_b in {u_ab,g,r,i,z} to linear flux proxy f_b with the inverse Luptitude relation f_b = 2*b_b*sinh(-0.4*ln(10)*m_b - ln(b_b)), using SDSS softening constants b_u=1.4e-10, b_g=0.9e-10, b_r=1.2e-10, b_i=1.8e-10, b_z=7.4e-10 (f0 normalized to 1). For each band define a reliability regime flag s_b = 1(|f_b| <= 10*b_b), and a soft-clipped flux \tilde f_b = sign(f_b)*max(|f_b|, b_b). Build features from \tilde f_b: flux-log colors for adjacent bands, second-order differences across log10 wavelength order, and a least-squares slope/curvature of log(\tilde f) along {u,g,r,i,z}; compute magnitude-vs-flux color mismatch for each adjacent pair, e.g. delta_c_ug = (u_ab-g) - log(\tilde f_u/\tilde f_g), similarly for other pairs. Add shape summary features on soft-clipped normalized flux allocation (sum abs \tilde f, max share, entropy-like concentration, L2 concentration), and regime descriptors per row: soft_count = sum(s_b), soft_fraction = soft_count/5, negative_flux_count = sum(f_b<0), and a soft_regime_weight = 1 - soft_fraction. Interact slope/curvature features with (1-soft_fraction) and soft_fraction to separate high-SNR and low-SNR regime behavior. For all divisions include epsilon-safe clipping to avoid instability.
- expected_signal: By replacing noisy magnitude-domain colors with physical flux-domain structure near the asinh linearization break, the group can better preserve true SED ordering for faint objects and explicitly flag when color geometry is dominated by measurement floor effects, which should help disentangle quasars, galaxies, and stars in overlapping color-redshift regions and reduce ambiguity-driven boundary errors.
- risk: The transformation is SDSS-specific and tied to published b constants and u-band offset, so performance can degrade if the dataset’s photometry comes from different processing or zero-point conventions; clipping and ratio construction can still amplify noise for extreme values, the feature set may overlap with prior flux/locus groups, and additional nonlinear operations add some compute overhead for very large tables.

# Group Code Contract

Return only Python code. Do not use markdown fences.

Define semantic feature-group functions and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.

Generate only the feature-group module: Python definitions for feature-group
preprocessing. A separate fixed runtime wrapper imports this module and is
responsible for logging, timing, dependency ordering, output-column renaming,
final DataFrame assembly, and all non-preprocessing work.

Each feature function must use this signature:

```python
def add_group_name(raw, deps, aux):
    ...
    return new_features
```

Rules:
- `raw` is the raw/base train+test covariate frame without target labels. It includes ID columns.
- `deps` is a dict of dependency outputs by logical group name. Use it only when this group declares dependencies.
- `aux` is an auxiliary DataFrame when available, otherwise empty.
- Return a pandas DataFrame containing only new local feature columns with `index=raw.index`.
- Preserve row count, row order, and index exactly.
- Do not return raw/input columns.
- Do not mutate `raw`, `deps`, or `aux` in place.
- Use clear local feature names. The executor will rename returned columns after the function finishes.
- Outputs may be numeric, boolean, categorical, or string scalar columns. Do not return nested lists, dicts, tuples, or sets.
- You may compute covariate-only train+test statistics from `raw`; do not use target labels, validation labels, model outputs, or leaderboard feedback.
- Do not read project data files, write files, train models, create `main()`, concatenate final blocks, or implement orchestration.
- Do not implement timing decorators or logging wrappers. The group executor logs every group call and duration.
- Top-level code may contain only imports, function definitions, literal constants, and `FEATURE_GROUPS`.
- Do not call functions in top-level assignments. For example, do not write `EDGES = np.array(...)`, `CUTS = pd.IntervalIndex(...)`, or any other assignment whose right-hand side calls a function or constructor.
- If a constant needs conversion to a NumPy/Pandas object, store it as a literal tuple/list at module level and convert it inside the feature function.

Register groups like this:

```python
FEATURE_GROUPS = [
    {
        "name": "group_name",
        "fn": add_group_name,
        "depends_on": [],
        "description": "One sentence describing this feature group.",
    }
]
```

AutoGluon wrapper boundary:
- Do not train AutoGluon.
- Do not import or instantiate `TabularPredictor`.
- Do not call `.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`, or `.leaderboard()`.
- Do not define `main()`.
- Do not define `preprocess(df)`.
- Do not read project data files or `./input`.
- The fixed AutoGluon wrapper handles all of those steps outside this generated file.
