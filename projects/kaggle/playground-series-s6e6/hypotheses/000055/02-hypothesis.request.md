# Project Context

## Goal
Predict the stellar class for each test-set object.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using balanced accuracy between predicted class labels and the true class. Submission file must contain `id,class` with one label per test row, where `class` is one of GALAXY, STAR, or QSO.

## Data description
`train.csv` contains 577347 rows with 10 feature columns plus `id`, `galaxy_population`, `spectral_type`, and the target `class`. `test.csv` contains the same predictors without the target across 247435 rows. `sample_submission.csv` shows the required submission columns `id` and `class`. The target is a 3-class stellar classification problem with labels GALAXY, QSO, and STAR.

# Instruction

Analyze the selected ROOT hypothesis, the project context, and the previous
revisions.

Create the next revision by expanding or improving the hypothesis while
preserving its substantive feature-group idea. You are not writing code. You are
not creating a new feature group.

The revision should make the hypothesis more precise, internally consistent,
implementable, or better justified. Improve the hypothesis text, especially
`strategy`, when there is a concrete useful improvement. Do not force arbitrary
changes.

Use previous revisions only as context. If they contain useful details, use that
context, but do not mechanically merge them. The output must be one coherent
revised hypothesis using exactly the same JSON schema as a newly generated
hypothesis.

# Web Search

Live web search is enabled. If internet verification is useful, use the
`web_search` tool before writing the revised hypothesis. Check at most 3 sources.
Use web search only to verify domain facts, feature-engineering background,
validation risks, or implementation constraints relevant to the selected
hypothesis. Do not use web search to invent a different feature-group idea, copy
a public solution, or broaden the scope. If web search is not useful, continue
without inventing sources.

# Selected Hypothesis

Hypothesis ID: 000055

Previous versions:

- rev 1: asinh-Jacobian weighted SED shape
  group_name=asinh_jacobian_weighted_shape
  family=flux_uncertainty_geometry
  summary=Model the five-band photometry in the SDSS asinh flux domain and encode continuum-shape features after down-weighting each band by its SDSS asinh low-signal confidence, so color relations from noisy bands do not dominate class boundaries.
  strategy=For each band b in {u,g,r,i,z}, recover normalized flux from the SDSS asinh relation using published softening parameters (b_u=1.4e-10, b_g=0.9e-10, b_r=1.2e-10, b_i=1.8e-10, b_z=7.4e-10): q_b = 2*b_b*sinh(-(ln 10/2.5)*m_b - ln b_b), where m_b is the provided magnitude and q_b = f/f0. Compute low-signal index x_b = q_b/(2b_b) and a continuous reliability score w_b = |x_b|/(1+|x_b|), clipped to [0,1]. Use these as weights to build one-band and cross-band shape features: (1) weighted mean flux mu = Σ(w_b*q_b)/Σw_b, (2) weighted orthogonal polynomial coefficients (slope and curvature) from least-squares fitting q_b-mu against band order index t∈{0,1,2,3,4}, (3) reliability-weighted flux contrasts c_ug, c_gr, c_ri, c_iz where each contrast is scaled by sqrt((w_a w_b)/(w_a+w_b)) to suppress uncertain endpoints, and (4) regime descriptors n_eff=Σw_b, frac_reliable = count(w_b>0.6)/5, weak_band=min(w_b), and reliable_band_count=count(w_b>0.2). If n_eff is near zero, fall back to robustly imputed values from the corresponding global redshift-bin medians and emit a binary low-confidence flag so the model can separate extrapolated values.
  expected_signal=Because SDSS magnitudes are asinh-based and u/z become progressively noisy at survey limits, this group should better preserve physically meaningful continuum differences for faint quasars and galaxies while suppressing spurious color excursions from low-SNR bands that blur class boundaries in raw magnitude-space differences.
  risk=High overlap with existing asinh/flux-domain transforms is possible, so gains may be incremental; the method depends on fixed b coefficients from SDSS documentation and can become unstable for extreme magnitudes, requiring clipping/fallback handling to avoid numerical outliers and risking residual leakage of noise patterns as signal.
