# Project Context

## Goal
Predict the stellar class for each test-set object.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using balanced accuracy between predicted class labels and the true class. Submission file must contain `id,class` with one label per test row, where `class` is one of GALAXY, STAR, or QSO.

## Data description
`train.csv` contains 577347 rows with 10 feature columns plus `id`, `galaxy_population`, `spectral_type`, and the target `class`. `test.csv` contains the same predictors without the target across 247435 rows. `sample_submission.csv` shows the required submission columns `id` and `class`. The target is a 3-class stellar classification problem with labels GALAXY, QSO, and STAR.

# Instruction

Analyze the selected ROOT hypothesis, the project context, and the previous
revisions.

Create the next revision by expanding or improving the hypothesis while
preserving its substantive feature-group idea. You are not writing code. You are
not creating a new feature group.

The revision should make the hypothesis more precise, internally consistent,
implementable, or better justified. Improve the hypothesis text, especially
`strategy`, when there is a concrete useful improvement. Do not force arbitrary
changes.

Use previous revisions only as context. If they contain useful details, use that
context, but do not mechanically merge them. The output must be one coherent
revised hypothesis using exactly the same JSON schema as a newly generated
hypothesis.

# Web Search

Live web search is enabled. If internet verification is useful, use the
`web_search` tool before writing the revised hypothesis. Check at most 3 sources.
Use web search only to verify domain facts, feature-engineering background,
validation risks, or implementation constraints relevant to the selected
hypothesis. Do not use web search to invent a different feature-group idea, copy
a public solution, or broaden the scope. If web search is not useful, continue
without inventing sources.

# Selected Hypothesis

Hypothesis ID: 000015

Previous versions:

- rev 1: Spectroscopic Redshift Domain Margins
  group_name=redshift_template_domain_margins
  family=redshift_geometry
  summary=Encode where each object falls relative to the physically and procedurally distinct redshift domains used for stellar, galaxy, and quasar spectral interpretation, so the classifier sees redshift as class-feasibility geometry rather than only as a raw scalar.
  strategy=Using only the observed redshift, create deterministic signed margins and clipped distances to SDSS-inspired class domains: stellar near-zero radial-velocity domain with |redshift|, sign(redshift), and distance outside an approximate +/-1200 km/s interval converted by z ~= v/c; galaxy trial domain [-0.01, 1.00] with lower and upper signed margins plus an in-domain flag; quasar trial domain [0.0333, 7.00] with lower and upper signed margins plus an in-domain flag; ordered regime indicators and distances around astrophysically meaningful quasar/galaxy boundaries at z=0, 0.0333, 1.0, 2.2, 3.0, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.0; replace impossible arithmetic results with finite clipped values and preserve exact boundary equality as in-domain. Reference basis: https://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/redshifts.php and https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/algorithms/legacy_target_selection/.
  expected_signal=Balanced accuracy may improve because STAR objects should concentrate tightly around zero redshift, GALAXY objects should mostly occupy low-to-moderate positive redshift, and QSO objects can occupy the broad high-redshift range where SDSS quasar selection and fitting behavior differs sharply from galaxy and stellar templates.
  risk=This group is highly correlated with the raw redshift column and may be redundant for flexible learners; hard SDSS-derived boundaries can also be unstable if the synthetic train/test generator perturbs redshift distributions away from the documented survey/template regimes.
